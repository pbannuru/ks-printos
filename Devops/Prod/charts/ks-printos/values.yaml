  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious

  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
  # Example:
  # limits:
  #   cpu: 100m
